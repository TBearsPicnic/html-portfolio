<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  In a cozy corner of a bright, cheerful room in Brighton, a small teddy bear
  named Barnaby sat eagerly on a soft armchair. It was a special day—Barnaby's
  best friends were coming over for his birthday party. He had been waiting for
  what felt like hours, his fluffy ears perked up in excitement, and his
  stitched eyes twinkling in anticipation.

  The room was decorated with colorful balloons and a big banner that read
  "Happy Birthday, Barnaby!" A plate of honey cakes sat on a table, and a
  rainbow of wrapping paper surrounded a pile of gifts, all waiting to be
  unwrapped. But none of that mattered to Barnaby right now. What mattered most
  was the arrival of his friends—his companions from the nearby toy shop: Penny
  the rabbit, Charlie the lion, and Daisy the owl.

  Barnaby had been dreaming of this moment for days, imagining the laughter, the
  games, and the joy of sharing his special day with those he loved. As the
  clock ticked closer to party time, his little heart raced. He knew that when
  his friends arrived, it would be the happiest birthday ever. Together, they
  would create memories that would last a lifetime, and Barnaby couldn't wait to
  hug them all and say, “We're finally here!”
